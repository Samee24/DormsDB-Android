An android application for DormsDB, a dorm-management software that serves Grinnell College.


In the midst of creating a an android application for DormsDB, a dorm-management website, created by a friend(Alex Mitchell: https://dormsdb.alexthemitchell.com), for Grinnell College. The app currently allows for searches to be conducted in four parameters, namely: Air-conditioning, printer accessibility, gender neutrality and laundry facilities. The app utilizes an API containing JSON data, returning the required information in list view - the information is comprised of several things, such as ratings, type, number of raters, cluster and hall. This extra information is displayed in an additional activity when a user clicks on the corresponding list view item.  The app needs design remodeling, and some polishing but otherwise fully functional. 

Also added a Login Screen(24/03/2014) that asks for user credentials before allowing the user to conduct any searches.
